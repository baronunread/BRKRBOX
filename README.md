*Completely handsolderable!*

For the firmware do not refer to the standard GP-2040CE as the PCB/pin layout is very different and it's better to just download a precompiled firmware.
You can find the firmware ready for installation in the releases of [this repository](https://github.com/baronunread/BRKRBOX-GP2040-CE).
