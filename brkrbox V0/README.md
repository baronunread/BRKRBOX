# BRKRBOX V0

For this controller you will need to provide through your own printer and a PCB service these pieces:
- 1 * [3D printed case top and bottom](https://github.com/baronunread/BRKRBOX/tree/main/brkrbox%20V0/case)
- 1 * [PCB](https://github.com/baronunread/BRKRBOX/tree/main/brkrbox%20V0/pcb)

And you will need to purchase the following. I added a couple of links for some of the more tricky pieces, they're not referrals and I do not gain any money from them they're only for helping out in the building process.
- 5 * M3x10mm flat head screws
- 12 * Kailh Choc V2 **OR** 12 * Kailh Choc V1
- 12 * V2 Caps **OR** 12 V1 Caps. I grabbed [these V2 ones](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007272793813.html)
- 1 * Raspberry Pi Pico
- 5 * 6x6x7mm tactile switches
- 5 * 6x6 tacticle switch caps. I grabbed [these ones](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32846395636.html)
- 1 * 4 Pin I2C OLED 128 x 64 0.96inch. Make sure to grab something with the pinout like [these ones](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006365881525.html). There's other ones where the VCC and GND are inverted, watch out! 
- 1 * Resettable Fuse 1812 500 mA. I grabbed [these ones](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007077302451.html)
- 2 * 22R through hole resistors for the USB Peripheral

For easier purchase you should try to buy these from LCSC or buy valid replacements yourself. I'll provide the LCSC links down below:
- 1 * [Through hole USB A](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-Connectors_SHOU-HAN-10-0-4C6-3-ZB_C6386909.html)
- 1 * [5P Slide Switch, 8.7x4.4mm](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Slide-Switches_HanElectricity-SS12D07VG4_C22435633.html)
- 2 * [6P Slide Switch, 12.9x4.5mm](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Slide-Switches_HanElectricity-SS13D07VG4_C22435636.html)

You might also need a small header to use it like so for the installation of the OLED Screen. This way it will lay flat:
