Suggested LED placement varies slightly between the two versions - the V2 position is denoted by a much thinner silkscreen rectangle than the V1.

The plate hole also has a difference in size of 0.015mm between V1 and V2; both sizes are shown by thin squares inside the outer perimeter square.","https://www.kailhswitch.com/mechanical-keyboard-switches/box-switches/choc-type-hot-swap-socket.html"

This model doesn't reflect the reality of the pin holes. What's important about this model is the USB C size and position to better help 3D modelling. This is V1 which has a port further away from the side of the PCB.
